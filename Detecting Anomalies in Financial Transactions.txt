# ### Dataset description
# >1. step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).
# 2. type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.
# 3. amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.
# 4. nameOrig - customer who started the transaction
# 5. oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction
# 6. newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction
# 7. nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction
# 8. oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
# 9. newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
# 10. isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
# 11. isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
# >  Numbers is everything in transaction monitoring. Numbers decide whether it is a fraudulent activity or not. Let us look at the overall numbers using pivot function

# # 🔧 Feature engineering 
# >  Time to get our hands dirty with feature engineering. With the available information it is hard to train the model and get better results. Hence we move onto create new features by altering the existing features. In this we create three functions which creates a highly relevant feature for the domain
# >
# > 1. **Difference in balance:** It is an universal truth that the amount debited from senders account gets credited into the receivers account without any deviation in cents. But what if there is a deviation incase of the amount debited and credited. Some could be due to the charges levied by the service providers, yet we need to flag such unusual instances
# > 2. **Surge indicator:** Also we have to trigger flag when large amount are involved in the transaction. From the distribution of amount we understood that we have a lot of outliers with high amount in transactions. Hence we consider the 75th percentile(450k) as our threshold and amount which is greater than 450k will be triggered as a flag
# > 3. **Frequency indicator:** Here we flag the user and not the transaction. When there is a receiver who receives money from a lot of people, it could be a trigger as it can be for some illegal games of chance or luck. Hence it is flagged when there is a receiver who receives money for more than 20 times.
# >4. **Merchant indicator:** The customer ids in receiver starts with 'M' which means that they are merchants and they obviously will have a lot of receiving transactions. So we also flag whenever there is a merchant receiver

# <b>💭Thoughts:</b> <br>
# We can see who won the prize-it is Naive Bayes. Other algorithms have also performed in par with NB especially Random Forest and KNN. It sure looks overfitted as the accuracy is near 100% which can be verified using the test data. Before that lets do hyperparameter tuning on NB<br>

# Hyperparameter Tuning
# > Lets fit the Naive bayes model by tuning the model with its parameters. Here we are gonna tune var_smoothing which is a stability calculation to widen (or smooth) the curve and therefore account for more samples that are further away from the distribution mean. In this case, np.logspace returns numbers spaced evenly on a log scale, starts from 0, ends at -9, and generates 100 samples.
